# CS 3220 - Intro to Web Programming

# Intro

Welcome to intro to web programming summer session! In this class, we will learn
how to build web application together from the front end to back end and putting
everything together at the end!

Specifically, we will start the class by learning front end (HTML, CSS and 
JavaScript). Labs and homework in this first quarter of the class will be
focusing on building the user interface and its behavior. In second half of the
class, we will be building the back-end in Java to support up the data storage
and processing.

In back-end session, we will start by learning Java Servlet and JSP. A lot of
existing companies, which has Java back-end, may still have these legacy 
applications implemented in this manner. This is why we start by learning 
Servlet and JSP. Then, we will learn how to refactor such application to more
modern approach such as implementing a RESTful service.

Moreover, we will also be learning some server to server communication by having
your server communicating to my worker simulation server through common RESTful
service calls.

In the end, we should have a runnable application for you to show as portfolio!

## Prerequisites

Please note that you are expected to know Java programming before the class. In
this class we will be using Java quite a lot on the back end. If you are not
experienced enough in Java programming. Please find time to self study! A gentle
suggestion would be studying your old text book!
